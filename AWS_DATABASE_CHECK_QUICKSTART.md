# 🚀 AWS DATABASE AUDIT - QUICK START GUIDE

## Your Situation

You have an AWS RDS MySQL database running, but there are **potential schema mismatches** between:

1. Your actual database tables
2. The backend controller code
3. The test data we created

This guide will help you identify and fix them.

---

## 📋 STEP-BY-STEP DIAGNOSTIC PROCESS

### ✅ OPTION 1: Automatic Diagnosis (Recommended - 5 minutes)

**If you have MySQL client installed:**

```powershell
# Open PowerShell in your project directory
cd c:\Users\admin\Desktop\easygo

# Run the automatic diagnostic
.\check_aws_database.ps1
```

**What it will do:**

1. ✅ Connect to your AWS database
2. ✅ Get exact table structures
3. ✅ Show column names and types
4. ✅ Display sample data
5. ✅ Save report to: `aws_database_report.txt`

**If you don't have MySQL client:**

- Download it: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/
- Or install MySQL Workbench: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

---

### 📊 OPTION 2: Manual Database Check (10 minutes)

**If PowerShell script doesn't work:**

1. **Open MySQL Workbench** (or any MySQL GUI client)
2. **Connect to your AWS database:**

   - Host: `frbilling.cxqc440y2mz9.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
   - Port: `3306`
   - User: `admin`
   - Password: Check your `.env` file
   - Database: `frbilling`

3. **Run this command:**

   ```sql
   -- Show all bookings table columns
   SHOW COLUMNS FROM bookings;
   ```

4. **Look for these fields and note which ones exist:**

   - ✅ `service_type` (should be: Surface, Air, Express)
   - ✅ `weight`
   - ✅ `freight_charge`
   - ✅ `gst_amount`
   - ✅ `fuel_surcharge`
   - ❓ `customer_id` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `mode` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `type` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `char_wt` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `qty` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `amount` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `tax_amount` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `fuel_amount` (exists or not?)
   - ❓ `invoice_id` (exists or not?)

5. **Run this for rate_master:**

   ```sql
   -- Show all rate_master table columns
   SHOW COLUMNS FROM rate_master;

   -- Show sample rates
   SELECT * FROM rate_master LIMIT 3;
   ```

6. **Note if rate_master has:**
   - ✅ `service_type` (value examples: "Surface", "Air")
   - ❓ `type` field (for Doc vs NonDoc)
   - ✅ `gst_percentage`
   - ✅ `fuel_surcharge`

## 🔍 ANALYSIS: What Results Mean

### Scenario A: Migration Schema Used (LIKELY)

**You'll see these fields:**

```
✅ sender_name, sender_phone, sender_address
✅ receiver_name, receiver_phone, receiver_address
✅ service_type (NOT mode)
✅ weight (NOT char_wt)
✅ pieces (NOT qty)
✅ freight_charge (NOT amount)
✅ gst_amount (NOT tax_amount)
✅ fuel_surcharge (NOT fuel_amount)
✅ total_amount
```

**Missing fields:**

```
❌ customer_id
❌ receiver (short field)
❌ pincode (short field)
❌ mode
❌ type
❌ char_wt
❌ qty
❌ amount
❌ tax_amount
❌ fuel_amount
❌ invoice_id
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **Database follows migrations, but controller code uses different field names!**

**Action:** Fix the controller code (bookingController.js)

---

### Scenario B: Controller Schema Used (UNLIKELY)

**You'll see these fields:**

```
✅ customer_id
✅ receiver (short field)
✅ address (short field)
✅ pincode (short field)
✅ mode
✅ type
✅ char_wt
✅ qty
✅ amount
✅ tax_amount
✅ fuel_amount
✅ invoice_id
```

**Missing fields:**

```
❌ sender_name, sender_phone
❌ receiver_name, receiver_phone
❌ service_type
❌ weight
❌ pieces
❌ freight_charge
❌ gst_amount
❌ fuel_surcharge
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **Database follows controller, but migrations are outdated!**

**Action:** Migrations might have been modified or recreated

---

### Scenario C: Hybrid (MIXED)

**You'll see some fields from both scenarios**

**Status:** ⚠️ **Database was manually altered after migrations!**

**Action:** Document all fields and I'll create corrected code

---

## 🎯 WHAT TO DO AFTER DIAGNOSIS

### If Scenario A (Most Likely):

1. **Create a backup:**

   ```sql
   -- In AWS RDS:
   CREATE TABLE bookings_backup AS SELECT * FROM bookings;
   ```

2. **Create missing columns:**

   ```sql
   -- Add customer tracking
   ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN customer_id VARCHAR(50) AFTER franchise_id;

   -- Add invoice linking
   ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN invoice_id INT AFTER customer_id;

   -- Add rate tracking
   ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN rate_master_id INT AFTER invoice_id;
   ```

3. **Update rate_master to support Doc/NonDoc:**

   ```sql
   -- Add type field
   ALTER TABLE rate_master ADD COLUMN type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'NonDoc' AFTER id;

   -- Or create a new rate_master_v2 with the field
   ```

4. **I'll then provide:**
   - ✅ Updated bookingController.js (uses actual field names)
   - ✅ Corrected test data for your schema
   - ✅ SQL migrations to add missing columns
   - ✅ UI verification checklist

## 📱 URGENT: Check Your UI

While we diagnose, check if your UI is showing data correctly:

### BookingFormPage.jsx

```
What to check:
1. Can you create a booking? YES / NO
2. Does it show rate calculation? YES / NO
3. Are calculations correct? YES / NO
4. Is data saved to database? YES / NO
```

### GenerateInvoicePage.jsx

```
What to check:
1. Can you search for bookings? YES / NO
2. Do bookings appear in list? YES / NO
3. Can you generate invoice? YES / NO
4. Are totals calculated? YES / NO
5. Is invoice saved? YES / NO
```

**Share these answers with the diagnostic report!**

---

## 🚨 RED FLAGS - If You See These

### Red Flag #1: "Column doesn't exist" error

```
Error: Unknown column 'amount' in 'field list'
```

✅ **Means:** Database uses `freight_charge` not `amount`
✅ **Fix:** Update controller to use `freight_charge`

### Red Flag #2: No invoice linking

```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE invoice_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Returns 0 rows
```

✅ **Means:** Bookings never marked as "Billed"
✅ **Fix:** Add invoice_id and update status after invoice creation

### Red Flag #3: Can't distinguish Doc/NonDoc rates

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT service_type FROM rate_master;
-- Returns: Surface, Air, Express (no Doc/NonDoc)
```

✅ **Means:** All rates are generic, can't differentiate pricing
✅ **Fix:** Add `type` field to rate_master
