## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Controller Methods Added (4 new functions):

#### 1. `getInvoiceSummary()`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Summary Cards Show 0

**Problem:** All summary cards display ₹0.00

**Causes:**

- No invoices in database
- Franchise ID mismatch
- Network error

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Check if invoices exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE franchise_id = 1;

# Check payment status distribution
SELECT payment_status, COUNT(*) FROM invoices GROUP BY payment_status;

# Check browser console for errors
# Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab
```

---

### Issue 2: Invoice List Not Loading

**Problem:** Table shows "No records found" after clicking Show

**Causes:**

- Filter too restrictive
- No invoices match GST criteria
- API endpoint error

**Solutions:**

```javascript
// Check API call in browser console
// Should see: GET /api/payments/invoice-list?page=1&limit=10&gst=true

// Check backend logs
// Terminal: Look for "Get invoice list error"

// Test API directly in Postman/Thunder Client
GET http://localhost:5000/api/payments/invoice-list?gst=true
Headers: Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

---

### Issue 3: Payment Track Returns Empty

**Problem:** Payment Details page shows no records

**Causes:**

- No payments recorded in database
- Date range too narrow
- Customer ID doesn't exist

**Solutions:**

```sql
-- Check if payments exist
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE franchise_id = 1;

-- Check date range of payments
SELECT MIN(payment_date), MAX(payment_date) FROM payments;

-- Check customer IDs
SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM invoices;
```

---

### Issue 4: Customer Credit Shows 0

**Problem:** Both Total Credit and Balance show 0

**Causes:**

- Customer ID not found
- No invoices for customer
- Typo in customer ID

**Solutions:**

```sql
-- Verify customer exists
SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE customer_id = 'YourCustomerId';

-- Check payment status for customer
SELECT payment_status, COUNT(*), SUM(net_amount)
FROM invoices
WHERE customer_id = 'YourCustomerId'
GROUP BY payment_status;
```

---

### Issue 5: 401 Unauthorized Error

**Problem:** API calls return 401 error

**Causes:**

- Token expired
- Not logged in
- Token not in localStorage

**Solutions:**

```javascript
// Check token in browser console
console.log(localStorage.getItem("token"));

// If null, login again
// Navigate to /login and authenticate

// Check token expiration
// Backend: Check JWT_EXPIRATION in .env (default: 1d)
```

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication:

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Token verified via `authenticate` middleware
- Franchise ID extracted from token

### Authorization:

- Users can only access their franchise data
- All queries filtered by `franchise_id`
- No cross-franchise data access

### Input Validation:

- Customer ID validated as required
- Date ranges validated
- Search terms sanitized
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes:

```sql
-- Recommended indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_franchise_payment ON invoices(franchise_id, payment_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_customer ON invoices(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_invoice ON payments(invoice_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_date ON payments(payment_date);
```

### Query Optimization:

- Use LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination
- Avoid SELECT \* where possible
- Use COALESCE for NULL handling
- Index foreign keys
