## 🚀 How It Works Now

### Booking Creation Flow

```
1. User creates booking
2. System fetches company defaults (companyService)
3. Calculates company charges (fuel %, royalty %, etc.)
4. Applies charges to booking
5. Validates calculation (calculationValidationService)
6. Saves with correct amounts ✓
```

### Invoice Generation Flow

```
1. System gathers all bookings for invoice
2. Sums tax_amount from each booking
3. Uses sum as GST amount (NOT recalculating)
4. Calculates final invoice total
5. Saves with accurate tax ✓
```

## 🔍 How to Test

### Test Company Charges

1. Go to Booking Module
2. Select a company/customer with rates set
3. Create booking with ₹100 base amount
4. Check:
   - fuel_amount = (100 × fuel_surcharge_percent) / 100
   - other_charges = royalty + insurance + fixed charges
   - total = amount + tax + fuel + other

### Test GST Fix

1. Create invoice from multiple bookings
2. Check invoice GST = Sum of booking tax_amounts
3. Should NOT recalculate from invoice amount

### Test Frontend Features

1. Click table rows to expand → See charge breakdown
2. Try sorting by Amount and Weight
3. Enter invalid input → See error message
4. Search again → See recent search suggestion
5. Download invoice → Check if downloaded correctly
