## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION IN 4 STEPS

### Step 1: Backup Current File (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend/src/controllers

# Backup original
copy bookingController.js bookingController.js.BACKUP

# Or if using Git
git checkout bookingController.js  # Keep backup in version control
```

### Step 2: Replace with Corrected Version (1 minute)

```bash
# Copy corrected version
copy bookingController_CORRECTED.js bookingController.js

# Or rename
mv bookingController_CORRECTED.js bookingController.js
```

### Step 3: Restart Server (1 minute)

```bash
# In backend directory
npm stop      # Stop current server
npm start     # Restart with new code
```

### Step 4: Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# See TESTING section below

## ✅ BEFORE & AFTER COMPARISON

### ❌ BEFORE (Broken)

```javascript
// OLD CODE - SENDS WRONG FIELD NAMES
const bookingData = {
  customer_id,              ❌ Field doesn't exist in DB
  receiver: receiver,       ❌ Should be receiver_name, receiver_phone, etc.
  address: address,         ❌ No such field
  pincode,                  ❌ Should be receiver_pincode
  mode,                     ❌ Should be service_type
  char_wt,                  ❌ Should be weight
  qty,                      ❌ Should be pieces
  amount,                   ❌ Should be freight_charge
  tax_amount,               ❌ Should be gst_amount
  fuel_amount,              ❌ Should be fuel_surcharge
  dtdc_amt,                 ❌ Not in database
  total,                    ❌ Should be total_amount
  status: "Booked",         ❌ Should be "booked" (lowercase)
  gst_percent,              ❌ Not in database
  fuel_percent,             ❌ Not in database
};
```

### ✅ AFTER (Corrected)

```javascript
// NEW CODE - USES CORRECT DATABASE FIELDS
const bookingData = {
  franchise_id,
  booking_number,           ✅ Auto-generated
  consignment_number,
  booking_date,

  sender_name,              ✅ All 6 sender fields
  sender_phone,
  sender_address,
  sender_pincode,

## 📋 KEY FIELD CHANGES

### Field Name Mapping

```
OLD FIELD          NEW FIELD              WHY CHANGED
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
customer_id        ❌ REMOVED             Not in database
mode               → service_type         Correct DB field
char_wt            → weight              Extracted from doc
qty                → pieces              Correct DB field
amount             → freight_charge      Calculated value

dtdc_amt           ❌ REMOVED            Calculated auto
receiver           → receiver_name       + 5 more fields
address            → receiver_address    Correct DB field
pincode            → receiver_pincode    Correct DB field
status: "Booked"   → status: "booked"   Lowercase value
gst_percent        ❌ REMOVED            Not needed in DB
fuel_percent       ❌ REMOVED            Not needed in DB
```

## 🔧 WEIGHT EXTRACTION LOGIC

```javascript
// Inside new controller
const extractWeightFromDocument = (filePath) => {
  // Read Excel file
  const workbook = XLSX.readFile(filePath);
  const worksheet = workbook.Sheets[workbook.SheetNames[0]];
  const jsonData = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(worksheet);

  // Look for weight column (case-insensitive)
  const firstRow = jsonData[0];

  // Try these column names (in order)
  const weightColumns = [
    "weight",
    "Weight",
    "wt",
    "Wt",
    "Weight (kg)",
    "weight_kg",
  ];

  for (const col of weightColumns) {
    if (firstRow[col]) {
      return parseFloat(firstRow[col]);
    }
  }

  // If not found, throw error
  throw new Error("Could not extract weight from document");
};

// Usage:
const weight = extractWeightFromDocument(req.file.path);
// Result: 2.5
```

---

## 💰 CHARGE CALCULATION

```javascript
// What the system does automatically now

// 1. Look up rate from rate_master
const rate = await calculateBookingRate(
  franchiseId,
  sender_pincode,
  receiver_pincode,
  service_type,
  weight,          // ← From document
  pieces,
  other_charges
);

// 2. Extract rate details
const freight_charge = rate.lineAmount;      // ← Calculated
const gst_amount = rate.taxAmount;            // ← Calculated
const fuel_surcharge = rate.fuelAmount;       // ← Calculated

// 3. Calculate total
const total_amount =
  freight_charge + gst_amount + fuel_surcharge + other_charges;

// 4. Store in database (No manual input needed!)
const bookingData = {
  freight_charge,     ✅
  gst_amount,         ✅
  fuel_surcharge,     ✅
  total_amount,       ✅
  ...
};
```

---

## 🎫 BOOKING NUMBER GENERATION

```javascript
// Automatically generated
const generateBookingNumber = () => {
  const timestamp = Date.now().toString().slice(-6); // Last 6 digits
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000)
    .toString()
    .padStart(4, "0");
  return `BK-${timestamp}-${random}`;
};

// Example output:
// BK-123456-7890
// BK-654321-4321
// BK-999999-0001
```

---

## 📊 DATABASE VERIFICATION

After creating a booking, run these queries:

### Query 1: Check Booking Details

```sql
SELECT
  id, booking_number, consignment_number,
  service_type, weight, pieces,
  freight_charge, gst_amount, fuel_surcharge, total_amount,
  status, payment_status, created_at
FROM bookings
WHERE id = 42;  -- Replace with actual ID
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ `service_type = "Air"`
- ✅ `weight = 2.5`
- ✅ `pieces = 1`
- ✅ `freight_charge = 500` (calculated)
- ✅ `gst_amount = 90` (calculated)
- ✅ `fuel_surcharge = 25` (calculated)
- ✅ `total_amount = 715` (calculated)
- ✅ `status = "booked"`
- ✅ `payment_status = "unpaid"`

### Query 2: Check Sender/Receiver Details

```sql
SELECT
  sender_name, sender_phone, sender_pincode, sender_city,
  receiver_name, receiver_phone, receiver_pincode, receiver_city
FROM bookings
WHERE id = 42;
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ All sender fields populated
- ✅ All receiver fields populated

### Query 3: Check Tracking Entry

```sql
SELECT booking_id, consignment_number, status, location, remarks
FROM tracking
WHERE booking_id = 42;
```

**Expected Results:**

- ✅ `status = "booked"`
- ✅ `location = "Origin"`
- ✅ `remarks = "Consignment booked successfully"`

## 🚨 ERROR HANDLING

### Common Errors & Solutions

| Error                               | Cause                                   | Solution                              |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| "Document file required"            | No file uploaded                        | Upload Excel file                     |
| "Could not extract weight"          | Weight column not found                 | Ensure "weight" or "wt" column exists |
| "No matching rate found"            | Rate master empty for this service_type | Add rate entries to rate_master       |
| "Consignment number already exists" | Duplicate consignment                   | Use unique consignment number         |
| "Required fields: ..."              | Missing sender/receiver details         | Fill all required fields              |
| "Failed to create booking"          | Database error                          | Check database connection             |

## 📝 REQUIRED DATABASE ENTRIES

Before testing, ensure rate_master has entries:

```sql
-- Example rate entries
INSERT INTO rate_master (
  franchise_id, from_pincode, to_pincode, service_type,
  weight_from, weight_to, rate, fuel_surcharge, gst_percentage, status
) VALUES
-- Air rates
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Air', 0, 2.5, 500, 5, 18, 'active'),
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Air', 2.5, 5, 400, 5, 18, 'active'),
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Air', 5, 10, 350, 5, 18, 'active'),

-- Surface rates
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Surface', 0, 2.5, 300, 3, 18, 'active'),
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Surface', 2.5, 5, 250, 3, 18, 'active'),

-- Express rates
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Express', 0, 2.5, 600, 7, 18, 'active');
```
