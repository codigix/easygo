## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Bookings not appearing in Generate Invoice

**Solution:**

1. Verify bookings exist for the customer in date range
2. Check customer_id matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Go to Booking > Check Booking List to verify bookings

### Problem: Summary cards show ₹0.00

**Solution:**

1. Generate at least one invoice first
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if invoices exist in database

### Problem: "Booking not found" in Generate Single Invoice

**Solution:**

1. Verify consignment number exists
2. Check spelling/case of consignment number
3. Ensure booking belongs to your franchise

### Problem: Invoice number duplicate error

**Solution:**

1. Leave Invoice No field empty for auto-generation
2. Check existing invoices for the year
3. Use unique number if entering manually

### Problem: Calculate button not working
