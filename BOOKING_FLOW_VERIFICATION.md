# ✅ Booking Flow Verification Report

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Route Ordering Bug (FIXED)**

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:**

- The `/filter`, `/no-booking-list`, and `/recycle/list` routes were coming AFTER the generic `/:id` route
- Express processes routes top-to-bottom, so `/:id` was matching `/filter` before the filter route could be reached
- Result: 404 error when calling `/api/bookings/filter?customer_id=CUST001`

**Solution:**

- Reordered routes in `backend/src/routes/bookingRoutes.js`
- Moved all specific routes BEFORE the generic `/:id` route
- Now follows Express routing best practices

**Routes Fixed:**

```
❌ OLD (WRONG):
router.get("/:id", ...);        // Matches /filter ❌
router.get("/filter", ...);     // Never reached

✅ NEW (CORRECT):
router.get("/filter", ...);     // Matches /filter ✅
router.get("/no-booking-list", ...);  // Matches /no-booking-list ✅
router.get("/:id", ...);        // Falls back to ID matching
```
