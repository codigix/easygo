## 🔧 Backend Files

### Created:

1. `backend/migrations/20240101000014_update_stationary_for_consignments.cjs`
2. `backend/src/controllers/stationaryConsignmentController.js`

### Modified:

1. `backend/src/routes/stationaryRoutes.js` - Added consignment and bulk barcode routes

## 📦 Dependencies Added

### Backend:

```json
{
  "xlsx": "^0.18.5"
}
```

Already installed: `multer` (from previous feature)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Automatic Calculations:

- Total consignments = End No - Start No + 1
- Remaining = Total - Used
- Expiry days calculation from receipt date

### Data Validation:

- End number must be >= Start number
- File format validation for bulk upload
- Franchise-specific data isolation
- Required field validation

### User Experience:

- Real-time calculation display
- Color-coded expiry warnings
- Collapsible sidebar menu
- Responsive table design
- Pagination for large datasets
- Search and filter capabilities
- Confirmation dialogs for delete actions

## 🔒 Security Features

- Authentication required for all endpoints
- Franchise-specific data isolation (users can only see their own data)
- File upload validation
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- Foreign key constraints with cascade delete

## 📊 Business Logic

### Expiry Calculation:

```javascript
const receipt = new Date(receiptDate);
const today = new Date();
const diffDays = Math.ceil((receipt - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));

if (diffDays < 0) return "Expired";
else if (diffDays === 0) return "Today";
else return `${diffDays} Days`;
```

### Consignment Range Calculation:

```javascript
const start = parseInt(startNo);
const end = parseInt(endNo);
const total = end - start + 1; // Inclusive range
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Consignments not loading

- **Solution:** Check browser console for API errors
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check authentication token validity

### Issue: File upload fails

- **Solution:** Ensure file is in Excel/CSV format
- Check file size (should be reasonable)
- Verify `uploads/temp/` directory exists

### Issue: Sidebar menu not expanding

- **Solution:** Refresh the page
- Check browser console for React errors
- Verify route configuration in App.jsx

### Issue: Expiry dates showing incorrectly

- **Solution:** Verify receipt_date is stored correctly in database
- Check timezone settings
- Ensure date format is consistent (YYYY-MM-DD)
