## STEP 1: Setup RateMaster (Copy All)

```sql
-- ===========================================
-- STEP 1: DELETE OLD TEST DATA (IF ANY)
-- ===========================================
DELETE FROM bookings WHERE franchise_id IN (SELECT id FROM franchises WHERE name LIKE '%FastShip%');
DELETE FROM invoices WHERE franchise_id IN (SELECT id FROM franchises WHERE name LIKE '%FastShip%');
DELETE FROM rate_master WHERE franchise_id IN (SELECT id FROM franchises WHERE name LIKE '%FastShip%');
DELETE FROM franchises WHERE name LIKE '%FastShip%';

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 2: CREATE FRANCHISE
-- ===========================================
INSERT INTO franchises (name, city, state, contact_person, mobile, email, status, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('FastShip Express', 'Mumbai', 'Maharashtra', 'Rajesh Kumar', '9876543210', 'rajesh@fastship.com', 'active', NOW(), NOW());

SET @franchise_id = (SELECT id FROM franchises WHERE name = 'FastShip Express' LIMIT 1);

-- ===========================================
-- STEP 3: INSERT RATEMASTER DATA (12 RATES)
-- ===========================================

-- AIR + DOC
INSERT INTO rate_master (franchise_id, type, mode, from_pincode, to_pincode, weight_from, weight_to, rate, gst_percentage, fuel_surcharge, status)
VALUES (@franchise_id, 'Doc', 'Air', '*', '*', 0, 5, 50, 18, 5, 'active');

INSERT INTO rate_master (franchise_id, type, mode, from_pincode, to_pincode, weight_from, weight_to, rate, gst_percentage, fuel_surcharge, status)
VALUES (@franchise_id, 'Doc', 'Air', '*', '*', 5, 10, 80, 18, 5, 'active');

INSERT INTO rate_master (franchise_id, type, mode, from_pincode, to_pincode, weight_from, weight_to, rate, gst_percentage, fuel_surcharge, status)
VALUES (@franchise_id, 'Doc', 'Air', '*', '*', 10, 20, 120, 18, 5, 'active');

VALUES (@franchise_id, 'Doc', 'Surface', '*', '*', 5, 10, 40, 18, 2, 'active');

INSERT INTO rate_master (franchise_id, type, mode, from_pincode, to_pincode, weight_from, weight_to, rate, gst_percentage, fuel_surcharge, status)
VALUES (@franchise_id, 'Doc', 'Surface', '*', '*', 10, 20, 60, 18, 2, 'active');

VALUES (@franchise_id, 'NonDoc', 'Surface', '*', '*', 10, 20, 120, 18, 3, 'active');

-- Verify RateMaster
SELECT 'RATEMASTER SETUP COMPLETE' as status, COUNT(*) as total_rates FROM rate_master WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
```

**Expected Output:** `RATEMASTER SETUP COMPLETE | 12 |`

## STEP 2: Create Bookings with Auto-Calculation (Copy All)

```sql
-- ===========================================
-- STEP 4: INSERT BOOKINGS (AUTO-CALCULATED)
-- ===========================================

-- BOOKING 1: Light Doc (Air) - â‚¹61.50

## STEP 4: Generate Invoice for Customer 101 (Copy All)

```sql
-- ===========================================
-- STEP 5: GENERATE INVOICE 1 (CUSTOMER 101)
-- ===========================================

-- Create Invoice Record
INSERT INTO invoices (

-- Verify Invoice 1
SELECT 'INVOICE 1 CREATED' as status, COUNT(*) as items,
       SUM(item_total) as total
FROM invoice_items WHERE invoice_id = @invoice_id_1;
```

**Expected Output:** `INVOICE 1 CREATED | 2 | 151.50 |`

---

## STEP 5: Generate Invoice for Customer 102 (Copy All)

```sql
-- ===========================================
-- STEP 6: GENERATE INVOICE 2 (CUSTOMER 102)
-- ===========================================

-- Create Invoice Record
INSERT INTO invoices (

  'Generated', NOW(), NOW()
);

SET @invoice_id_2 = LAST_INSERT_ID();

-- Create Invoice Line Items
INSERT INTO invoice_items (

  quantity, unit_price, line_amount, tax_amount, fuel_amount, item_total,
  created_at, updated_at
) VALUES
(
  @invoice_id_2, 2, 'FASTSHIP-PKG-001',
  'Electronics Package - 2 units - Air Service',
  2, 160.00, 320.00, 57.60, 25.60, 403.20,
  NOW(), NOW()

(
  @invoice_id_2, 4, 'FASTSHIP-PKG-002',
  'Office Supplies - Bulk Order - Surface Service',
  5, 120.00, 600.00, 108.00, 18.00, 726.00,
  NOW(), NOW()

-- Mark Bookings as Billed
UPDATE bookings SET invoice_id = @invoice_id_2, status = 'Billed'
WHERE id IN (2, 4);

-- Verify Invoice 2
SELECT 'INVOICE 2 CREATED' as status, COUNT(*) as items,
       SUM(item_total) as total
FROM invoice_items WHERE invoice_id = @invoice_id_2;
```

**Expected Output:** `INVOICE 2 CREATED | 2 | 1129.20 |`

## STEP 6: Verify Complete Workflow (Copy & Run Each)

### Verification 1: RateMaster Setup

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rates FROM rate_master WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
-- Expected: 12
```

### Verification 2: Bookings Summary

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
  ROUND(SUM(amount), 2) as total_line_amount,
  ROUND(SUM(tax_amount), 2) as total_gst,
  ROUND(SUM(fuel_amount), 2) as total_fuel,
  ROUND(SUM(amount + tax_amount + fuel_amount), 2) as grand_total
FROM bookings WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
-- Expected: 4 bookings | 1045.00 | 188.10 | 47.60 | 1280.70
```

### Verification 3: Invoices Summary

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_invoices,
  ROUND(SUM(sub_total), 2) as sub_total,
  ROUND(SUM(gst_total), 2) as gst_total,
  ROUND(SUM(fuel_total), 2) as fuel_total,
  ROUND(SUM(net_amount), 2) as net_amount
FROM invoices WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
-- Expected: 2 invoices | 1045.00 | 188.10 | 47.60 | 1280.70
```

### Verification 4: Bookings to Invoices Mapping

```sql
SELECT
  b.id,
  b.consignment_number,
  b.customer_id,
  ROUND(b.amount + b.tax_amount + b.fuel_amount, 2) as booking_total,
  i.invoice_number,
  b.status
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN invoices i ON b.invoice_id = i.id
WHERE b.franchise_id = @franchise_id
ORDER BY b.customer_id, b.id;
-- Expected: All 4 bookings linked to invoices with status = 'Billed'
```

### Verification 5: Invoice Line Items

```sql
SELECT
  i.invoice_number,
  COUNT(*) as items,
  ROUND(SUM(ii.item_total), 2) as total
FROM invoice_items ii
JOIN invoices i ON ii.invoice_id = i.id
WHERE i.franchise_id = @franchise_id
GROUP BY i.invoice_number;
-- Expected:
-- INV-2024-001 | 2 | 151.50
-- INV-2024-002 | 2 | 1129.20
```

### Verification 6: No Double-Taxation Check

```sql
-- Check if GST was recalculated (it shouldn't be)
SELECT
  'Booking GST' as type,
  ROUND(SUM(tax_amount), 2) as gst_amount
FROM bookings
WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id
UNION ALL
SELECT
  'Invoice GST' as type,
  ROUND(SUM(gst_total), 2) as gst_amount
FROM invoices
WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
-- Expected: Both should be 188.10 (matches exactly - no recalculation)
```

---

## Summary Dashboard

```sql
-- Final Summary View
SELECT
  'RateMaster Entries' as metric, CAST(COUNT(*) as CHAR) as value
FROM rate_master WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Bookings Created', CAST(COUNT(*) as CHAR)
FROM bookings WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Invoices Generated', CAST(COUNT(*) as CHAR)
FROM invoices WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Bookings Amount', CONCAT('â‚¹', ROUND(SUM(amount + tax_amount + fuel_amount), 2))
FROM bookings WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Total Invoice Amount', CONCAT('â‚¹', ROUND(SUM(net_amount), 2))
FROM invoices WHERE franchise_id = @franchise_id;
```

**Expected Output:**

```
RateMaster Entries | 12
Bookings Created | 4
Invoices Generated | 2
Total Bookings Amount | â‚¹1280.70
Total Invoice Amount | â‚¹1280.70
```
