# Column Type Preservation Fix - Auto-Population Issue ✅

## Problem Identified

When moving from Slab 2 to Slab 3, the "Additional Kg" column values were being placed in the middle columns instead of staying at the **end**, causing column type misalignment.

### What Was Happening (Before Fix)

**Slab 2 Structure:**

```
[Upto Kg: 50, Additional Kg: 100]
```

**Slab 3 Expected Structure:**

```
[Upto Kg: 50, Upto Kg: empty, Additional Kg: 100]
```

**But previous logic was producing:**

```
[Upto Kg: 50, Additional Kg: 100, empty]  ❌ Wrong! Additional Kg is in middle
```

## Why This Matters

- **Upto Kg columns** represent weight brackets (can have multiple)
- **Additional Kg column** is always the LAST column (only one, for additional weight charges)
- These have different meanings and must be preserved by column TYPE, not just position

## Solution Implemented

Modified all 5 auto-population hooks to preserve column TYPES:

### The Correct Logic

```javascript
[
  ...row.slice(0, -1), // All "Upto Kg" cols
  ...Array(currentSlabColumnCount - prevSlabColumnCount).fill(""), // New empty "Upto Kg" cols
  row[row.length - 1], // "Additional Kg" always at end
];
```

### Step-by-Step Example

**Moving from Slab 2 to Slab 3:**

1. Input row from Slab 2: `[50, 100]`
   - `row.slice(0, -1)` = `[50]` ← All but last (Upto Kg)
   - `Array(1).fill("")` = `[""]` ← 1 new empty column
   - `row[row.length - 1]` = `100` ← Last column (Additional Kg)
2. Result for Slab 3: `[50, "", 100]` ✅ Correct!

**Moving from Slab 3 to Slab 4:**

1. Input row from Slab 3: `[50, "", 100]`
   - `row.slice(0, -1)` = `[50, ""]` ← All but last
   - `Array(1).fill("")` = `[""]` ← 1 new empty column
   - `row[row.length - 1]` = `100` ← Last column (Additional Kg)
2. Result for Slab 4: `[50, "", "", 100]` ✅ Correct!

## All 5 Courier Types Updated

1. ✅ **Dox** - Auto-population preserves column types
2. ✅ **Dtdc PLUS** - Auto-population preserves column types
3. ✅ **Express Cargo** - Auto-population preserves column types
4. ✅ **Priority** - Auto-population preserves column types (numeric slabs)
5. ✅ **Dtdc PTP** - Both ptp and ptp2 tables preserve column types

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a company
- [ ] Go to **Dox** tab
- [ ] Fill Slab 2 with data:
  - Row 1: Upto Kg = 50, Additional Kg = 100
  - Row 2: Upto Kg = 150, Additional Kg = 200
- [ ] Click **Save Slab 2** button
- [ ] Switch to **Slab 3** tab
- [ ] **Verify:**
  - Column 1: 50, 150 (Upto Kg from Slab 2) ✅
  - Column 2: empty, empty (New Upto Kg) ✅
  - Column 3: 100, 200 (Additional Kg from Slab 2) ✅
- [ ] Add values to Column 2: 75, 175
- [ ] Click **Save Slab 3**
- [ ] Switch to **Slab 4** and verify same pattern
- [ ] Test with other courier types: Express Cargo, Priority, Dtdc PLUS, Dtdc PTP

## Expected Behavior ✅

- Slab 2 → Slab 3: `[Upto Kg, Additional Kg]` → `[Upto Kg, Upto Kg, Additional Kg]`
- Slab 3 → Slab 4: `[Upto Kg, Upto Kg, Additional Kg]` → `[Upto Kg, Upto Kg, Upto Kg, Additional Kg]`
- All column types preserved correctly
- Data flows seamlessly between slabs
- **Additional Kg always stays in the last column**

## Technical Implementation

**Key Technique**:

```javascript
row.slice(0, -1); // Remove last column (Additional Kg)
// ... add new columns ...
row[row.length - 1]; // Re-add as last column
```

This ensures the "Additional Kg" column type is always preserved at its correct position (the end), regardless of how many new "Upto Kg" columns are added.

## Impact

✅ Users can seamlessly move between slabs
✅ All data stays aligned with correct column types
✅ Additional Kg charges remain in the correct column
✅ Consistent behavior across all courier types
