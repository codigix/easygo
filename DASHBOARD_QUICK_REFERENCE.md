## 🔐 Security Notes

### Authentication

```
✓ All endpoints require Bearer token
✓ Token extracted from localStorage
✓ Backend validates token
✓ Invalid token → 401 response
✓ Expired token → auto-logout
```

### Data Isolation

```
✓ All queries filter by franchise_id
✓ User A ≠ User B data
✓ SQL injections prevented
✓ Parameterized queries used
✓ XSS protection enabled
```

### Token Handling

```
✓ Never exposed in logs
✓ Sent only in Authorization header
✓ Not stored in URL
✓ Cleared on logout
✓ Refreshed on token expiry
```
