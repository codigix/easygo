# üéØ BOOKING CONTROLLER - CORRECTED VERSION GUIDE

## üìã OVERVIEW

A **new corrected version** of `bookingController.js` has been created that:

‚úÖ Uses **correct database field names**  
‚úÖ **Extracts weight from documents** (no manual input)  
‚úÖ **Calculates charges automatically** (no manual dtdc_amt)

‚úÖ **Includes all required fields** (sender/receiver details)  
‚úÖ **Generates booking numbers** automatically

## üîÑ WORKFLOW COMPARISON

### ‚ùå OLD WORKFLOW (Broken)

```
Manual Input  ‚Üí  Wrong Field Names  ‚Üí  Database Error
char_wt manually entered
dtdc_amt manually entered
mode (wrong) ‚Üí database expects service_type
Database rejects: Unknown fields
```

### ‚úÖ NEW WORKFLOW (Fixed)

```
Upload Document File
        ‚Üì
Extract Weight (Automatic)
        ‚Üì
Look up Rate in rate_master (service_type + weight)
        ‚Üì
Calculate Charges:
  - freight_charge = rate √ó pieces
  - gst_amount = freight_charge √ó 18%
  - fuel_surcharge = freight_charge √ó fuel%
        ‚Üì
Save with CORRECT field names to database
        ‚Üì
‚úÖ Booking Created Successfully

## üíæ DATABASE STORAGE

### What Gets Saved to Bookings Table

```sql
INSERT INTO bookings (
  franchise_id,
  booking_number,        -- Auto-generated: BK-TIMESTAMP-RANDOM
  consignment_number,
  booking_date,

  -- Sender Details
  sender_name,
  sender_phone,
  sender_address,
  sender_pincode,
  sender_city,
  sender_state,

  -- Receiver Details

```

---

## üîß STEP-BY-STEP CREATION FLOW

### Step 1: Receive Request

```javascript
POST /api/bookings
Body: Form data + File
```

### Step 2: Validate Required Fields

```
‚úì consignment_number
‚úì booking_date
‚úì service_type
‚úì sender details (name, phone)
‚úì receiver details (name, phone, pincode)
‚úì file uploaded
```

### Step 3: Check Duplicate Consignment

```sql
SELECT id FROM bookings
WHERE consignment_number = ? AND franchise_id = ?
```

**If exists ‚Üí Return 400 error**

### Step 4: Extract Weight from Document

```javascript
// Extract from Excel file
const weight = extractWeightFromDocument(filePath);
// Looks for: "weight", "Weight", "wt", "Wt", etc.
```

### Step 5: Fetch Rate from rate_master

```sql
SELECT * FROM rate_master
WHERE franchise_id = ?
  AND service_type = ?
  AND weight_from <= ?
  AND weight_to >= ?
  AND status = 'active'
ORDER BY weight_from DESC
LIMIT 1
```

### Step 6: Calculate All Charges

```javascript
freight_charge = rate.rate √ó pieces
gst_amount = freight_charge √ó (rate.gst_percentage / 100)
fuel_surcharge = freight_charge √ó (rate.fuel_surcharge / 100)
total_amount = freight_charge + gst_amount + fuel_surcharge + other_charges
```

### Step 7: Generate Booking Number

```javascript
Format: BK-[TIMESTAMP(6 digits)]-[RANDOM(4 digits)]
Example: BK-123456-7890
```

### Step 8: Save to Database

```sql
INSERT INTO bookings SET {...all data...}
```

### Step 9: Create Tracking Entry

```sql
INSERT INTO tracking SET {
  booking_id,
  consignment_number,
  status: "booked",
  location: "Origin",
  remarks: "Consignment booked successfully"
}
```

### Step 10: Return Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 42,
    "booking_number": "BK-123456-7890",
    "consignment_number": "CN123456",
    "weight_extracted": 2.5,
    "freight_charge": 500,
    "gst_amount": 90,
    "fuel_surcharge": 25,
    "total_amount": 615
  }
}
```

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Backup Current File

```bash
cp backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js.backup
```

### Step 2: Replace with Corrected Version

```bash
cp backend/src/controllers/bookingController_CORRECTED.js backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js
```

### Step 3: Test with Sample Data

**Sample Document (Excel):**

```
| Weight (kg) |
|-------------|
| 2.5         |
```

**Sample Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/bookings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "consignment_number=CN123456" \
  -F "booking_date=2024-01-15" \
  -F "service_type=Air" \
  -F "sender_name=John" \
  -F "sender_phone=9876543210" \
  -F "sender_address=123 Main" \
  -F "sender_pincode=110001" \
  -F "sender_city=Delhi" \
  -F "sender_state=Delhi" \
  -F "receiver_name=Jane" \
  -F "receiver_phone=9876543211" \
  -F "receiver_address=456 Park" \
  -F "receiver_pincode=400001" \
  -F "receiver_city=Mumbai" \
  -F "receiver_state=Maharashtra" \
  -F "content_description=Documents" \
  -F "other_charges=100" \
  -F "file=@document.xlsx"
```

### Step 4: Verify Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": 42,
    "booking_number": "BK-123456-7890",
    "weight_extracted": 2.5,
    "freight_charge": 500,
    "gst_amount": 90,
    "fuel_surcharge": 25,
    "total_amount": 615
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Check Database

```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE id = 42;
SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE booking_id = 42;
```

## üìù MIGRATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] Backup current bookingController.js
- [ ] Replace with corrected version
- [ ] Restart Node.js server
- [ ] Test with sample document
- [ ] Verify database insertion
- [ ] Test rate calculation
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Test with different service types (Air, Surface, Express)
- [ ] Test weight extraction from Excel
- [ ] Verify sender/receiver details saved correctly
- [ ] Test with different weight ranges
- [ ] Test duplicate consignment detection
- [ ] Test file cleanup after errors

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "Document file required to extract weight"

**Solution:** Upload an Excel file with the request

### Error: "Could not extract weight from document"

**Solution:** Ensure document has a column named "weight", "Weight", "wt", or similar

### Error: "No matching rate found"

**Solution:**

- Ensure rate_master has entries for the service_type and weight range
- Check rate_master data for franchise
- Verify service_type matches exactly (case-sensitive)

### Error: "Consignment number already exists"

**Solution:** Use a unique consignment_number

### Booking created but charges are wrong

**Solution:**

- Check rate_master entries
- Verify weight extraction worked (check console logs)
- Verify calculation formula

---

## üìä SAMPLE DATA FOR TESTING

### rate_master entries needed:

```sql
INSERT INTO rate_master (
  franchise_id, from_pincode, to_pincode, service_type,
  weight_from, weight_to, rate, fuel_surcharge, gst_percentage
) VALUES
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Air', 0, 2.5, 500, 5, 18),
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Air', 2.5, 5, 400, 5, 18),
(1, '110001', '400001', 'Surface', 0, 2.5, 300, 3, 18);
```

### Sample booking:

```json
{
  "consignment_number": "TEST001",
  "booking_date": "2024-01-15",
  "service_type": "Air",
  "sender_name": "Test Sender",
  "sender_phone": "9876543210",
  "sender_address": "123 Test St",
  "sender_pincode": "110001",
  "sender_city": "Delhi",
  "sender_state": "Delhi",
  "receiver_name": "Test Receiver",
  "receiver_phone": "9876543211",
  "receiver_address": "456 Test Ave",
  "receiver_pincode": "400001",
  "receiver_city": "Mumbai",
