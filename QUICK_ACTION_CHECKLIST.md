## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still getting 404 on filter endpoint

**Solution:**

1. Stop backend completely (Ctrl+C)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Clear your terminal (cls)
4. Run `npm run dev` again
5. Wait for "listening on port 5000"
6. Refresh frontend (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Problem: Bookings not loading in filter

**Solution:**

1. Check you have bookings with date range that matches your filter
2. Add a test booking first:
   - Go to `/booking/add`
   - Create a booking for today
   - Then filter for today's date
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Problem: "Migration already completed" message

**Solution:**
This is normal! It means migration #20 was already applied. Just continue with testing.

### Problem: Database connection error

**Solution:**

1. Verify MySQL is running
2. Check database credentials in `.env`
3. Verify database `frbilling` exists
4. Check port 3306 is not blocked
