## 🔐 SECURITY VERIFICATION

### ✅ Authentication Layer

```javascript
// All protected routes require Bearer token
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Token Verification:
✓ JWT secret: env.JWT_SECRET
✓ Expiration: 1 day (configurable)
✓ Algorithm: HS256
✓ User validation on each request
✓ Franchise isolation enforced
```

### ✅ Data Isolation

```javascript
// Every query includes franchise_id filter
WHERE franchise_id = req.user.franchise_id
// Prevents cross-franchise data leakage
```

### ✅ Password Security

```javascript
// Passwords hashed with bcryptjs
bcrypt.hash(password, 10);
// Passwords never stored in plain text
```

### ✅ Error Handling

```javascript
// Global error middleware prevents info leakage
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  res.status(err.status || 500).json({
    success: false,
    message: err.message || "Internal server error",
  });
});
```

### ✅ Security Headers

```javascript
// Helmet.js protects against common vulnerabilities
app.use(helmet({ crossOriginResourcePolicy: { policy: "cross-origin" } }));
```

### ✅ CORS Configuration

```javascript
// CORS restricted to frontend domain
cors({ origin: "http://localhost:3000", credentials: true });
// In production: Update to your domain
```

## 🗄️ DATA STORAGE VERIFICATION

### Add Stationary Form Data Flow Confirmation

```
✅ FORM INPUT:
   ├─ Receipt Date → receipt_date (DATE)
   ├─ Start No → start_no (VARCHAR 50)
   ├─ End No → end_no (VARCHAR 50)
   ├─ No of Leafs → no_of_leafs (INT)
   ├─ No of Books → no_of_books (INT)
   └─ Type → type (ENUM: All, DOX, NONDOX, EXPRESS)

✅ SERVER PROCESSING:
   ├─ Validate: end_no >= start_no
   ├─ Calculate: total_consignments = (end_no - start_no) + 1
   ├─ Initialize: used_consignments = 0
   ├─ Calculate: remaining_consignments = total_consignments
   └─ Set: status = 'active'

✅ DATABASE STORAGE:
   INSERT INTO stationary_consignments (
     franchise_id,        // From authenticated user
     receipt_date,        // From form
     start_no,           // From form
     end_no,             // From form
     no_of_leafs,        // From form
     no_of_books,        // From form
     total_consignments, // Calculated
     used_consignments,  // Default 0
     remaining_consignments, // Calculated
     type,               // From form
     status              // Default 'active'
   )

✅ DATA RETRIEVAL:
   SELECT * FROM stationary_consignments
   WHERE franchise_id = <USER_FRANCHISE>
   ORDER BY receipt_date DESC
```

### Active Records in Database

```
✅ Franchises → Records being created & managed
✅ Users → Login credentials stored & verified
✅ Bookings → Creating new consignments daily
✅ Invoices → Generated from bookings
