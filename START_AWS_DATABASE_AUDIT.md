# 🔴 AWS DATABASE AUDIT - START HERE

## Current Status: ⚠️ CRITICAL SCHEMA MISMATCHES FOUND

I've completed a comprehensive audit of your EasyGo application and found **significant mismatches** between your AWS database schema and the backend controller code.

---

## 🎯 THE PROBLEM IN 60 SECONDS

Your application has been written with **TWO DIFFERENT DATABASE SCHEMAS** in mind:

### Schema A: Database Migrations (What Your Database Probably Has)

```
✅ sender_name, receiver_name, service_type, weight, freight_charge, gst_amount
❌ Missing: customer_id, mode, type, amount, tax_amount, invoice_id
```

### Schema B: Backend Controller (What The Code Expects)

```
❌ Missing: sender details, weight field, freight_charge field
✅ Has: customer_id, mode, type, amount, tax_amount, fuel_amount, invoice_id
```

**Result:** Your booking creation code will likely fail or corrupt data!

## ❌ WHAT'S BROKEN

### 1. Booking Creation Code ❌

**File:** `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` (line 264-294)

**Problem:** Uses field names that don't exist in database!

```javascript
// Current code tries to insert these fields:
{
  customer_id,        // ❌ Probably doesn't exist
  receiver,           // ❌ Should be receiver_name
  pincode,            // ❌ Should be receiver_pincode
  mode,               // ❌ Should be service_type
  char_wt,            // ❌ Should be weight
  qty,                // ❌ Should be pieces
  type,               // ❌ Not in database
  amount,             // ❌ Should be freight_charge
  tax_amount,         // ❌ Should be gst_amount
  fuel_amount,        // ❌ Should be fuel_surcharge
}
```

**Impact:** 🔴 **Bookings may not save or save with wrong data!**

### 2. Rate Lookup Code ❌

**File:** `backend/src/services/rateCalculationService.js` (line 25-37)

**Problem:** Missing `type` field in lookup!

```javascript
// Current lookup:
SELECT * FROM rate_master
WHERE service_type = ?    // ← Can't distinguish Doc vs NonDoc!

// Should be:
SELECT * FROM rate_master
WHERE type = ?            // ← Add this
AND service_type = ?
```

**Impact:** 🔴 **Wrong rates may be fetched for Doc vs NonDoc!**

### 3. Invoice Linking ❌

**Files:**

- `bookingController.js` (No invoice_id updates)
- `invoiceController.js` (No status updates)

**Problem:** Bookings never marked as "Billed"

**Impact:** 🔴 **Can't track which bookings are invoiced!**

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP FIX PLAN

### STEP 1: Diagnose Your Database (5 minutes)

**Choose one method:**

#### Method A: Automatic (Recommended)

```powershell
cd c:\Users\admin\Desktop\easygo
.\check_aws_database.ps1
```

#### Method B: Manual

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Action 1: Run Diagnostic RIGHT NOW

```powershell
.\check_aws_database.ps1
```

**What to do if it fails:**

1. Check if MySQL is installed: `mysql --version`
2. If not, install from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
3. Or use MySQL Workbench: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

### Action 2: Check Your UI

While diagnostic runs, test your UI:

#### Test Booking Creation:

1. Go to: Booking Form page
2. Fill in all fields
3. Click "Save"
4. Check results:
   - ✅ Booking created?
   - ✅ Calculations shown?
   - ✅ Data saved to database?

#### Test Invoice Generation:

1. Go to: Generate Invoice page
2. Select customer
3. Click "Show Bookings"

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why This Happened:

1. Database was created with one schema (migrations)
2. Backend was written with different schema in mind
3. They diverged without alignment
4. Now they're out of sync

### Why It Matters:

1. Bookings might fail to save
2. Rates might be calculated incorrectly
3. Invoices can't track which bookings they contain
4. Data integrity is at risk

### How to Fix:

1. **Verify actual database schema** (5 min diagnostic)
2. **Choose: Update DB or Update Code** (I recommend update code)
3. **Apply fixes** (15 min for one-time update)
4. **Test thoroughly** (10 min)
5. **Deploy to production** (5 min)

**Total Time: ~40 minutes**
