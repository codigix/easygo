# Invoice Consignment Filter - Complete Fix

## Problem

When downloading an invoice for a specific consignment (e.g., "CODIGIIX INFOTECH108") from the chatbot, the PDF was showing **ALL consignments** from that invoice instead of just the requested one.

## Root Cause

1. **Case-Sensitivity Issue**: Consignment number comparisons in database queries were case-sensitive, potentially causing filter mismatches
2. **Whitespace Issue**: Leading/trailing spaces in consignment numbers weren't being trimmed before comparison
3. **Duplicate Rows**: LEFT JOIN in invoice query could produce duplicate rows if a booking had multiple invoice_items

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Backend - Invoice Download Endpoint** (`invoiceController.js`)

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/invoiceController.js` (Lines 889-907)

✅ **Changes Made**:

- Added `consignmentNo` parameter trimming (removes leading/trailing spaces)
- Changed comparison from `b.consignment_number = ?` to `LOWER(b.consignment_number) = LOWER(?)`
- Added `DISTINCT` keyword to prevent duplicate rows from JOIN operations

```javascript
// Before
if (consignmentNo) {
  bookingQuery += ` AND b.consignment_number = ?`;
  bookingParams.push(consignmentNo);
}

// After
let consignmentNo = req.query.consignmentNo || req.body?.consignmentNo;
if (consignmentNo) {
  consignmentNo = consignmentNo.trim();
}
...
if (consignmentNo) {
  bookingQuery += ` AND LOWER(b.consignment_number) = LOWER(?)`;
  bookingParams.push(consignmentNo);
}
```

### 2. **Backend - Chatbot Search** (`chatbotController.js`)

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/chatbotController.js` (Lines 219-231)

✅ **Changes Made**:

- Normalized consignment number with trim
- Changed to case-insensitive comparison

```javascript
// Before
const [bookings] = await db.query(
  `... WHERE b.consignment_number = ? AND b.franchise_id = ?`,
  [consignmentNo, franchiseId]
);

// After
const normalizedConsignmentNo = consignmentNo.trim();
const [bookings] = await db.query(
  `... WHERE LOWER(b.consignment_number) = LOWER(?) AND b.franchise_id = ?`,
  [normalizedConsignmentNo, franchiseId]
);
```

### 3. **Backend - Get Consignment Endpoint** (`chatbotController.js`)

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/chatbotController.js` (Lines 308-321)

✅ **Changes Made**:

- Same fixes as above: trim and case-insensitive comparison

## Frontend - Already Working

**File**: `frontend/src/components/ChatbotAssistant.jsx`

✅ **Status**: No changes needed

- Frontend correctly passes `consignmentNo` as URL parameter
- Uses `URLSearchParams.append()` which properly URL-encodes the value
- Download handler receives and uses the consignmentNo correctly

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps

1. Open chatbot in the application
2. Search for a consignment number (e.g., "CODIGIIX INFOTECH108")
3. Click "Download Invoice" button
4. Compare the PDF size:
   - **Should be smaller** than downloading the full invoice
   - **Should contain ONLY** the searched consignment, not all consignments from that invoice

### Automated Test

Run the included PowerShell script:

```powershell
./test_invoice_download.ps1
```

This will:

1. Download the full invoice (all consignments)
2. Download a filtered invoice (specific consignment)
3. Show file sizes for comparison

**Expected Result**: Filtered invoice file size should be noticeably smaller

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ Consignment numbers with mixed case (e.g., "CoDiGiiX InFoTeCh108")
✅ Consignment numbers with leading/trailing spaces
✅ Duplicate rows from multiple invoice_items entries

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/src/controllers/invoiceController.js`
2. ✅ `backend/src/controllers/chatbotController.js`
3. ⏭️ `frontend/src/components/ChatbotAssistant.jsx` (no changes needed)

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Backend server restarted after changes
- [ ] Chatbot search returns correct consignment
- [ ] Downloaded PDF shows only the requested consignment
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] No errors in backend logs
- [ ] Frontend shows success message after download

## Next Steps

1. Restart the backend server to apply changes
2. Test with different consignment numbers
3. Verify PDF content contains only the filtered consignment
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Important Notes

- Changes are **backward compatible** - downloads without consignmentNo parameter still work (show all consignments)
- All comparisons are now **case-insensitive** for better UX
- **DISTINCT** keyword prevents duplicate rows in the output
