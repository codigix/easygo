## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "No token provided"

```
‚ùå Solution: Add Authorization header with valid JWT token
‚úÖ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" ...
```

### Issue: "User not found or inactive"

```
‚ùå Problem: JWT token is invalid or user is inactive
‚úÖ Solution: Login again to get fresh token
```

### Issue: "Consignment not found"

```
‚ùå Problem: ID doesn't exist or belongs to different franchise
‚úÖ Solution: Use ID from create response, verify franchise isolation
```

### Issue: "Failed to fetch from database"

```
‚ùå Problem: MySQL not running or connection lost
‚úÖ Solution:
   1. Check MySQL service is running
   2. Verify credentials in .env
   3. Check database exists: SHOW DATABASES;
```

### Issue: "End No must be greater than or equal to Start No"

```
‚ùå Problem: Validation failed at form level
‚úÖ Solution: Ensure end_no >= start_no in API call
```
