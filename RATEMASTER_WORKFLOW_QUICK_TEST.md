# RateMaster Workflow - Quick Test Guide ‚ö°

## Quick Start: 3-Step Testing Process

---

## Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Create Test RateMaster Entry

**SQL Command**:

```sql
INSERT INTO rate_master (
  franchise_id,
  from_pincode,
  to_pincode,
  service_type,
  weight_from,
  weight_to,
  rate,
  gst_percentage,
  fuel_surcharge,
  status
) VALUES (
  1,              -- franchise_id
  '*',            -- from_pincode (any)
  '400001',       -- to_pincode (Mumbai)
  'Air',          -- service_type
  0,              -- weight_from
  10,             -- weight_to
  500,            -- rate (‚Çπ500 per kg)
  18,             -- gst_percentage
  2,              -- fuel_surcharge (2%)
  'active'
);

-- Note the ID returned, you'll need it for validation
```

---

## Step 2Ô∏è‚É£: Create Booking (Auto Rate Calculation)

**API Request**:

```bash
POST /api/bookings
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "consignment_no": "TEST001",
  "customer_id": "C-001",
  "booking_date": "2024-01-15",
  "char_wt": 2.5,
  "qty": 1,
  "mode": "AR",
  "pincode": "400001",
  "type": "ND",
  "other_charges": 100
}
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking created successfully",
  "data": { "id": 101 }
}
```

**Verify in Database**:

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  consignment_number,
  amount,
  tax_amount,
  fuel_amount,
  other_charges,
  total,
  gst_percent,
  fuel_percent
FROM bookings WHERE id = 101;

-- Expected output:
-- | 101 | TEST001 | 500 | 90 | 10 | 100 | 700 | 18 | 2 |
```

---

## Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Generate Invoice

**Create Multiple Bookings First** (for better testing):

```sql
-- Create 2-3 more bookings for the same customer
INSERT INTO bookings (...) VALUES (...);  -- 2nd booking
INSERT INTO bookings (...) VALUES (...);  -- 3rd booking
```

**Generate Invoice API Request**:

```bash
POST /api/invoices/generate-multiple
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customers": ["C-001"],
  "period_from": "2024-01-01",
  "period_to": "2024-01-31",
  "gst_percent": 18
}
```

**Expected Response**:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully generated 1 invoices",
  "count": 1
}
```

**Verify Invoice Created**:

```sql
SELECT
  invoice_number,
  customer_id,
  subtotal_amount,
  gst_amount_new,
  fuel_surcharge_total,
  net_amount
FROM invoices
WHERE customer_id = 'C-001'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## üßÆ Manual Calculation Verification

### Booking Amounts Should Be:

```
Rate from RateMaster: ‚Çπ500/kg
Weight: 2.5 kg
Quantity: 1

Calculation:
lineAmount = 500 √ó 1 = ‚Çπ500 ‚úì
taxAmount = 500 √ó 18% = ‚Çπ90 ‚úì
fuelAmount = 500 √ó 2% = ‚Çπ10 ‚úì
otherCharges = ‚Çπ100 ‚úì
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
total = 500 + 90 + 10 + 100 = ‚Çπ700 ‚úì
```

### Invoice Totals Should Be:

```
For 3 bookings (assuming same pattern):

Subtotal = 500 + 500 + 500 = ‚Çπ1500
GST = 90 + 90 + 90 = ‚Çπ270
Fuel = 10 + 10 + 10 = ‚Çπ30
Other = 100 + 100 + 100 = ‚Çπ300
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Net = 1500 + 270 + 30 + 300 = ‚Çπ2100 ‚úì
```

## üîç Detailed Validation Queries

### 1. Check All Bookings for a Customer

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  consignment_number,
  amount,
  tax_amount,
  fuel_amount,
  other_charges,
  total,
  invoice_id,
  status
FROM bookings
WHERE customer_id = 'C-001'
ORDER BY booking_date DESC;
```

### 2. Check Invoice Details

```sql
SELECT
  i.invoice_number,
  i.period_from,
  i.period_to,
  i.subtotal_amount,
  i.gst_amount_new,
  i.fuel_surcharge_total,
  i.other_charge,
  i.net_amount,
  COUNT(ii.id) as item_count
FROM invoices i
LEFT JOIN invoice_items ii ON i.id = ii.invoice_id
WHERE i.customer_id = 'C-001'
GROUP BY i.id;
```

### 3. Verify Invoice Items Match Bookings

```sql
SELECT
  ii.invoice_id,
  ii.booking_id,
  b.consignment_number,
  ii.amount as item_amount,
  b.total as booking_total,
  (ii.amount - b.total) as difference
FROM invoice_items ii
JOIN bookings b ON ii.booking_id = b.id
WHERE ii.invoice_id = 1;

-- All differences should be 0
```

### 4. Check Bookings Marked as Billed

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  consignment_number,
  status,
  invoice_id
FROM bookings
WHERE customer_id = 'C-001'
AND status = 'Billed';

-- Should show all bookings included in invoice
```

---

## ‚ùå Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "No matching rate found"

**Cause**: RateMaster entry doesn't match booking parameters
**Fix**:

```sql
-- Check if RateMaster entry exists
SELECT * FROM rate_master
WHERE from_pincode = '*' OR from_pincode = '...'
AND to_pincode = '400001'
AND service_type = 'Air'
AND weight_from <= 2.5
AND weight_to >= 2.5;

-- If empty, create one using Step 1
```

### Issue: Booking total doesn't match expected calculation

**Cause**: Rate calculation skipped due to missing fields
**Fix**:

```bash
# Ensure these fields are provided:
- char_wt (chargeable weight)
- qty (quantity)
- mode (AR/SR)
- pincode (destination)
```

### Issue: Invoice total incorrect

**Cause**: Double-counting of taxes
**Fix**: Verify all bookings have pre-calculated amounts

```sql
-- Check all bookings have tax_amount populated
SELECT COUNT(*) as without_tax
FROM bookings
WHERE customer_id = 'C-001'
AND tax_amount = 0;

-- Should be 0
```
