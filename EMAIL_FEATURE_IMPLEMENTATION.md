# üìß Invoice Email Feature - Complete Implementation

## üéØ Overview

The invoice email feature has been **fully implemented** across the entire application. Users can now send invoices to customers via email with a professional HTML template and PDF attachment.

---

## ‚úÖ Implementation Details

### 1. **Backend Email Service** (`backend/src/config/email.js`)

**Created:** Email transporter configuration with nodemailer

```javascript
Features:
‚úì Initializes SMTP transporter on server startup
‚úì Uses environment variables for SMTP configuration
‚úì Supports both secure (465) and non-secure (587) ports
‚úì Handles transporter initialization and reusability
‚úì Provides sendEmail() function for sending emails
```

**Environment Variables Required:**

```
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

---

### 2. **Backend Email Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/invoiceController.js`)

**Added Function:** `sendInvoiceEmail()`

```javascript
Endpoint: POST /api/invoices/:id/send-email

Features:
‚úì Validates invoice ID and recipient email
‚úì Fetches complete invoice data with franchise & customer details
‚úì Fetches booking items linked to invoice
‚úì Generates professional PDF from invoice template
‚úì Creates HTML email body with invoice details
‚úì Sends email with PDF as attachment
‚úì Returns success message with recipient email

Request Body:
{
  invoiceId: number,
  recipientEmail: string (required),
  subject: string (optional),
  message: string (optional)
}

Response:
{
  success: true,
  message: "Invoice sent successfully to customer@example.com"
}
```

**PDF Generation:**

- Uses same template as download feature: `backend/src/templates/invoice.ejs`
- Ensures consistency across all invoice delivery methods
- Handles filename sanitization for special characters

---

### 3. **Backend Route** (`backend/src/routes/invoiceRoutes.js`)

**New Route Added:**

```javascript
router.post("/:id/send-email", authenticate, sendInvoiceEmail);
```

All email requests require authentication via JWT token.

---

### 4. **Server Initialization** (`backend/src/server.js`)

**Added:**

```javascript
import { initEmailTransporter } from "./config/email.js";

// In startServer function:
initEmailTransporter();
```

Email transporter initializes automatically when server starts.

---

### 5. **Frontend Email Modal** (`frontend/src/components/EmailModal.jsx`)

**New Component:** Professional email sending modal with:

```javascript
Features:
‚úì Displays invoice number (read-only)
‚úì Pre-fills recipient email from customer data
‚úì Pre-fills default subject line
‚úì Large message textarea for custom message
‚úì Email validation before sending
‚úì Loading state with spinner
‚úì Success/error notifications
‚úì Auto-close on success after 1.5 seconds
‚úì Clean, professional UI with Tailwind styling

Props:
- isOpen: boolean - Modal visibility
- invoiceId: number - Invoice ID to send
- invoiceNumber: string - Display invoice number
- customerEmail: string - Pre-fill recipient email
- onClose: function - Close modal callback
- onSuccess: function - Success callback

```

**Styling:**

- Modern modal with overlay
- Responsive design
- Color-coded buttons (Cancel/Send)
- Inline error/success messages
- Disabled state for loading

---

‚úì New function: fetchCustomerEmail() - Fetches email from company DB

Workflow:
1. User fills invoice form and clicks "Generate"

5. User can click "Send Invoice From Email" button
