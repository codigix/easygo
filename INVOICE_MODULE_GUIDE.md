## 📝 Business Logic

### Invoice Number Generation

#### Format Patterns:

1. **Regular Invoice:** `INV/YYYY/0001`
2. **Without GST:** `INV/YYYY/WG/0001`

#### Logic:

```javascript
const count = await db.query(
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices WHERE YEAR(invoice_date) = YEAR(CURDATE())"
);
const invoiceNumber = `INV/${dayjs().format("YYYY")}/${String(
  count + 1
).padStart(4, "0")}`;
```

---

### Calculation Formulas

#### With GST:

```
Total = Sum of booking.total
FuelSurcharge = (Subtotal × FuelSurchargePercent) / 100
Subtotal = Total + FuelSurcharge
GSTAmount = (NetAmount × GSTPercent) / 100
NetAmount = Subtotal + RoyaltyCharge + DocketCharge + OtherCharge + GSTAmount
```

#### Without GST:

```
Total = Sum of booking.total
Subtotal = Total
NetAmount = Subtotal + RoyaltyCharge + DocketCharge + OtherCharge
```

---

### Multiple Invoice Generation

#### Process:

1. For each selected customer:
   - Fetch bookings in date range
   - Calculate totals
   - Generate invoice number
   - Insert invoice
   - Link bookings via invoice_items
2. Returns count of successfully generated invoices
3. Skips customers with no bookings in period

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Bookings Module:

- Fetches bookings by customer_id and date range
- Links bookings to invoices via `invoice_items` table
- Uses booking totals for invoice calculations
- New endpoint: `GET /api/bookings/consignment/:consignment_no`

### With Payments Module (Future):

- `payment_status` field tracks payment state
- `paid_amount` and `balance_amount` for partial payments
- Links to payments table via invoice_id
