## 💾 HOW CHARGES ARE CALCULATED NOW

### Automatic Calculation Process

```
1. Weight Extraction
   └─ Read Excel file uploaded with booking
   └─ Extract "weight" column value (e.g., 2.5 kg)

2. Rate Master Lookup
   └─ Query: SELECT * FROM rate_master WHERE
      - franchise_id = 1
      - service_type = "Air"
      - weight_from <= 2.5
      - weight_to >= 2.5
      - status = 'active'
   └─ Result: {rate: 500, gst%: 18, fuel%: 5}

3. Charge Calculations
   ├─ freight_charge = 500 × 1 = 500
   ├─ gst_amount = 500 × (18/100) = 90
   ├─ fuel_surcharge = 500 × (5/100) = 25
   └─ total_amount = 500 + 90 + 25 + other = 715

4. Database Storage
   └─ All values stored with CORRECT field names
```

  franchise_id = 1
  consignment_number = "CN123456"
  booking_date = "2024-01-15"

  receiver_address = "456 Park Ave"
  receiver_pincode = "400001"
  receiver_city = "Mumbai"
  receiver_state = "Maharashtra"

  service_type = "Air"                 -- From input
  weight = 2.5                         -- From document
  pieces = 1                           -- Default
  content_description = "Documents"

  freight_charge = 500                 -- Calculated!
  gst_amount = 90                      -- Calculated!
  fuel_surcharge = 25                  -- Calculated!
  other_charges = 100
  total_amount = 715                   -- Calculated!

  payment_mode = "cash"
  payment_status = "unpaid"
  status = "booked"                    -- Lowercase!

## ✅ VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### Database Check

```sql
-- Should see all these fields populated correctly
SELECT
  id, booking_number,
  sender_name, receiver_name,
  service_type, weight, pieces,
  freight_charge, gst_amount, fuel_surcharge, total_amount,
  status, payment_status, created_at
FROM bookings
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Should show:
-- ✅ booking_number populated
-- ✅ All sender/receiver fields
-- ✅ Correct field names
-- ✅ Calculated charges
-- ✅ status = "booked"
```

---

## 🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### Before (Broken) ❌

- Manual char_wt input (prone to errors)
- Manual dtdc_amt input (calculations done by user)
- Wrong field names sent to database
- Missing sender/receiver details
- No booking number generation
- Database errors on insert

### After (Fixed) ✅

- Weight extracted from documents
- Charges calculated by system
- Correct field names for database
- Complete sender/receiver info
- Booking numbers auto-generated
- Successful database insertion

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Document file required"

- **Cause:** No file uploaded with request
- **Fix:** Upload Excel file containing weight

### Issue: "Could not extract weight from document"

- **Cause:** Weight column not found in Excel
- **Fix:** Ensure column named "weight" or "wt" exists

### Issue: "No matching rate found"

- **Cause:** Rate master doesn't have entries for this service_type/weight
- **Fix:** Add rate entries to rate_master table

### Issue: Database error after deployment

- **Cause:** Still using old field names
- **Fix:** Verify bookingController.js was replaced correctly

### Issue: Wrong charges calculated

- **Cause:** Rate master entries incorrect
- **Fix:** Check rate_master for correct rates, gst%, fuel%
