## 🔧 What Each File Does

### Service: rateCalculationService.js

**8 Functions for complete rate workflow**:

```
1. fetchRateFromMaster()       → Query RateMaster for matching rate
2. calculateLineAmount()       → rate × quantity
3. calculateTaxAmount()        → lineAmount × gst%
4. calculateFuelSurcharge()    → lineAmount × fuel%
5. calculateNetAmount()        → Sum all components
6. calculateBookingRate()      → BOOKING: Complete calculation
7. calculateInvoiceTotals()    → INVOICE: Aggregate bookings
8. validateRateCalculation()   → Verify calculations correct
```

### Fixed: rateMasterController.js

**Lines 91-110**: Calculate Rate Endpoint

- ✅ Fixed: `rate.rate_per_kg` → `rate.rate`
- ✅ Added: GST and fuel info to response
- ✅ Added: Proper decimal formatting

### Fixed: bookingController.js

**Lines 1-2**: Added import for rate calculation service
**Lines 214-262**: New rate calculation logic

- ✅ Calls `calculateBookingRate()` service
- ✅ Calculates: lineAmount, tax, fuel
- ✅ Stores all breakdown components

**Lines 264-294**: Updated booking data object

- ✅ Added: `tax_amount`, `fuel_amount`, `gst_percent`, `fuel_percent`
- ✅ All values properly formatted to 2 decimals

### Fixed: invoiceController.js

**Lines 1-2**: Added import for calculations

**generateInvoice() - Lines 307-356**:

- ✅ Fetches pre-calculated booking amounts
- ✅ Creates invoice items with breakdown
- ✅ Marks bookings as "Billed"

**generateMultipleInvoices() - Lines 404-500**:

- ✅ Fetches UNBILLED bookings only
- ✅ Aggregates amounts without recalculation
- ✅ Marks all bookings as "Billed"

---

## 📊 Workflow Architecture

```
LAYER 1: RateMaster Setup
┌─ Define rates: Type, Mode, Zone, Weight Slab, Rate, GST%, Fuel%

     ↓

LAYER 2: Rate Calculation Service
┌─ Centralized logic: fetch, calculate, validate, aggregate

     ↓

LAYER 3: Booking Creation
┌─ Auto-calculate from RateMaster
├─ Store: amount, tax, fuel, percentages
└─ Return: booking with breakdown

     ↓

LAYER 4: Invoice Generation
┌─ Fetch: pre-calculated amounts
├─ Aggregate: Σ(amounts) without recalc
├─ Create: invoice with breakdown
└─ Mark: bookings as "Billed"
```

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Field Name Bug ✅

```
❌ BEFORE: rate.rate_per_kg (doesn't exist)
✅ AFTER:  rate.rate (correct field)
```

### Issue #2: Missing Rate Calculation ✅

```
❌ BEFORE: Booking accepts amount, no auto-calc
✅ AFTER:  Booking auto-calculates from RateMaster
```

### Issue #3: Double-Taxation ✅

```
❌ BEFORE: Invoice recalculates GST (double-tax)
✅ AFTER:  Invoice uses pre-calculated amounts
```

### Issue #4: No Calculation Tracking ✅

```
❌ BEFORE: No record of rates/percentages used
✅ AFTER:  All stored with booking for audit
```

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Quick Version (Copy & Paste)

1. Copy `rateCalculationService.js` → `backend/src/services/`
2. Replace 4 lines in `rateMasterController.js` (lines 91-108)
3. Replace 2 lines in `bookingController.js` (lines 1-2)
4. Add rate calculation logic to `bookingController.js` (lines 214-262)
5. Update `bookingData` object in `bookingController.js` (lines 264-294)
6. Update `invoiceController.js` generateInvoice() (lines 307-356)
7. Update `invoiceController.js` generateMultipleInvoices() (lines 404-500)
8. Run migration: `npm run migrate`

## 📈 Example Calculation Flow

### Input: Non-Doc Air Shipment

```
consignment_no: "CODIGIIX108"
customer_id: "C-001"
type: "ND" (Non-Doc)
mode: "AR" (Air)
char_wt: 3 kg
qty: 1
pincode: "400001"
other_charges: 50
```

### RateMaster Lookup

```
WHERE type='ND' AND mode='Air' AND weight_from<=3 AND weight_to>=3
→ Found: rate=500, gst=18%, fuel=2%
```

### Calculation

```
lineAmount = 500 × 1 = 500
taxAmount = 500 × 18% = 90
fuelAmount = 500 × 2% = 10
otherCharges = 50
────────────────────────
total = 500 + 90 + 10 + 50 = 650 ✓
```

### Booking Stored

```
amount: 500
tax_amount: 90
fuel_amount: 10
other_charges: 50
total: 650
gst_percent: 18
fuel_percent: 2
```

### Invoice (3 bookings)

```
subtotal = 500 + 500 + 500 = 1500
tax = 90 + 90 + 90 = 270
fuel = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30
other = 50 + 50 + 50 = 150
───────────────────────────
INVOICE TOTAL = 1950 ✓
```
