FROM courier_company_rates
WHERE company_id = 1
ORDER BY slab_type, row_name;

-- Should see:
-- Dox | Within City | Slab 2 | {"rate_1":"100","rate_2":"20"}

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Please create a company first!" when company is created

- **Cause**: `createdCompanyId` state not being set
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors in handleSubmit

### Issue: Buttons still showing "Save Rates" instead of "Save Slab 2"

- **Cause**: Code not updated or frontend not reloaded
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or rebuild frontend

### Issue: Form not blurring after company creation

- **Cause**: CSS class not applied
- **Solution**: Check if `opacity-50 pointer-events-none` classes are on the div

### Issue: Rates not saving to database

- **Cause**: Backend endpoint issue or rates not being formatted correctly
- **Solution**: Check browser DevTools network tab for error response

### Issue: "No valid rates" error but rates are entered

- **Cause**: Rate values being treated as strings, not numbers
- **Solution**: Ensure parseFloat() is working correctly, check backend logs
