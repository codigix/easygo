# Invoice Downloads Folder

This folder stores PDF invoice files that can be downloaded via the chatbot assistant.

## üìã Structure

- **Filename format**: `inv_[invoice_id].pdf` (e.g., `inv_2025_001.pdf`)
- **Location**: `/backend/invoices/`

## üîÑ How It Works

### Frontend (Chatbot)

1. User enters a consignment number in the chatbot
2. Backend fetches consignment details from the database
3. If the consignment has an `invoice_id`, it generates a reference: `inv_[invoice_id].pdf`
4. Chatbot displays "‚¨á Download Invoice" button
5. On click, frontend calls: `GET /api/invoices/download/inv_[invoice_id].pdf`
6. File is downloaded to user's system

### Backend

- Route: `GET /api/invoices/download/:file`
- Authentication: Required (via JWT token)
- Security: Files must be in `/backend/invoices/` directory
- Returns: PDF file as attachment

## üìù Adding Invoice Files

### Step 1: Generate or Create PDF

Create your PDF invoice file and name it following the format:

```
inv_[invoice_id].pdf
```

Example:

```
inv_2025_001.pdf
inv_2025_002.pdf
inv_20250001.pdf
```

### Step 2: Place File in This Folder

Copy the PDF file to:

```
/backend/invoices/inv_2025_001.pdf
```

### Step 3: Ensure Database Mapping

The `bookings` table must have an `invoice_id` field that matches:

- If booking has `invoice_id = 2025_001`
- Chatbot will look for file: `inv_2025_001.pdf`

## üîó Database Mapping

The system uses:

```sql
SELECT invoice_id FROM bookings WHERE consignment_number = ?
```

The `invoice_id` value is used to construct the filename:

```javascript
invoiceFile = `inv_${booking.invoice_id}.pdf`;
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Test

1. Place a test PDF: `/backend/invoices/inv_2025_001.pdf`
2. Open chatbot and enter a consignment number
3. Click "Download Invoice" button
4. File should download

### Sample cURL Command

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/download/inv_2025_001.pdf
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Path Settings

- Base directory: `/backend/invoices/`
- Subdirectories: Not supported (security restriction)
- Supported formats: PDF, HTML, etc.

### Backend Route

```javascript
router.get("/download/:file", authenticate, downloadInvoice);
```

### Frontend API Call

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:5000/api/invoices/download/${invoiceFile}`,
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
);
```

## üîí Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: JWT token must be valid
2. **Path Validation**: Files checked to be within `/invoices/` folder
3. **No Directory Traversal**: Cannot access files outside invoices folder
4. **Franchise Isolation**: User can only access own franchise's invoices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Invoice not available" Message

- Check if file exists in `/backend/invoices/`
- Verify filename matches: `inv_[invoice_id].pdf`
- Check database has `invoice_id` field populated

### "Download Failed" Error

- Verify backend server is running on port 5000
- Check authentication token is valid
- Verify file path permissions

### File Extension Issues

- Use `.pdf` extension for PDF files
- Use `.html` extension for HTML files
- Ensure correct MIME type in backend
