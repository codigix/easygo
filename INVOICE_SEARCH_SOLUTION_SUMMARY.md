## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Search not showing results

**Solutions**:

1. Check consignment number spelling
2. Try leaving one filter empty
3. Verify dates are in correct format
4. Check if bookings exist in that franchise
5. Look at browser console (F12) for errors

### Issue: Error "Please enter Consignment Number..."

**Solutions**:

1. Fill at least one search field
2. If using dates, fill BOTH Period From and Period To
3. Refresh the page and try again

### Issue: Old code not working

**Note**: All changes are backward compatible

- Old date-range-only searches still work ✓
- New consignment searches work ✓
- Mixed searches work ✓
